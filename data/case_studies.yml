    Seeing as the company is named Insurance by Jack, we wanted to portray a design that not only felt like Jack was talking to you, but made you feel welcome, safe and looked after—just as insurance should do. This lead to our idea of a lighthouse/nautical theme. A lighthouse keeps sailors safe, illustrating the protection insurance provides. Coincidentally, Jack—who the company is named after—was an avid fan of the sea! This later spawned the concept for the mascot of Jack himself.

    I am being completely honest here, Simple as Milk will change your company. They are so professional, never miss deadlines, and basically project manage themselves. As for their work, it speaks for itself. Everything they design is pixel perfect and well thought out with a document explaining why each and every decision was made.
    But, I think the greatest thing that they give you, is love and dedication.
