  ## Morning Morning.

  Here's the brief breakdown of the writing exercise I was describing to you. The brief aim of this is to be more comfortable creating and trashing ideas as well as learning to approach writing from another point of view.

  As my tutor used to say:
  > You've got to kill your babies

  ## Tips

  - I'd suggest you block off a full block of time for this kind of thing as it works far better when done over 1 or 2 days and doesn't really work when done in pieces.
  - Try to not think about the next steps at all, normally you wouldn't know about what the next steps would be so try to approach in in the same way as it'll benefit you far more.
  - Set yourself your goal amount for the numbers of final  and time
  - write the headlines & 1st paragraphs on flash cards to easily be able to group them together/discard them easily.

  ## Plan

  ### Step 1 (50 mins, ~100 headings)

  1. Buy 5 newspapers/magazines aimed at different audiences. Stay away from anything you've read already and try to only have 1 that is the kind of thing you would normally read.
  2. Set a timer for 10mins
  3. Quickly flick through and pick a spread (10secs)
  4. Find a headline and on a new flash card write a similar food based headline, ie. "Teens attention span now lowest ever" -> "Quick bites for busy teens" (20secs)
  5. Repeat till timer runs out
  6. Group articles together
  6. Repeat this for all 5 news sources
  7. Take a 10 min break

  ```
  Tip:
  Try to pick headlines with polarising styles/views
  ```
  ### Step 2 (2hours, ~50 initial paragraphs)

  8. Set a time for 20 mins
  9. For each news source write out an initial first paragraph (1-3 mins max)
  10. Repeat until until timer runs out
  11. Repeat for all 5 news sources
  12. Take a lunch break (30mins  - 1hour)

  ```
  Tip:
  If your struggling to think of one put it in a pile to come back to afterwArds. if you've got time. The trick is to be quick and not to think too much about any of it, it should be more auto writing rather than considered paragraphs.
  ```

  ### Step 3 (2hours, 24 improved headings & paragraphs)

  10. Select 24 headlines and initial paragraphs that have merit
  11. Tweak and improve on all headlines and initial paragraphs (5 mins)
  12. Repeat until all selected headlines and paragraphs have been improved.

  ### Step 2 (2hours, 12 initial articles)

   14. After your break read through all the improved paragraphs and reduce to the top 12 headlines and initial paragraphs
   15. Order them from best to worst
   16. Take the worst 3 and expand by 2 additional paragraphs (10 mins each)
   17. Take a break (10mins)
   18. Repeat in groups of 3 until complete
   19. Take a longer break (30mins)

   ```
  Tip:
  During the break try to do something that has no relevance to the writing, the aim is to return from the break with a fresh outlook and not to spend the time thinking about what you have/will write.
  ```

  ### Step 2 (2hours, 6 finished articles)
  ```
  Tip:
  This part can be done the next day
  ```

  20. Choose the 6 top articles
  21. Flesh them out into fully fledged newsletter (20 mins each)
  22. Take a 5 min break between each
  23. Go do something fun and enjoy the fruits of your labour
