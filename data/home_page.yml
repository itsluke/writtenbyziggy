about_me:
  - I’m a content strategist and copywriter with skills in product management, looking to join an exciting start up where I can combine my love of food with my writing skills.

  - I’ve worked with multiple brands to help them define the tone, voice and content of their copy across a range of platforms. Researching and profiling are key to my work, as it allows me to better understand the ‘why’ as well as the ‘how’. From here I use my skills in writing to turn high-level concepts into compelling medium and long form copy. I’ve also got experience managing teams, creating visual content and representing brands.
