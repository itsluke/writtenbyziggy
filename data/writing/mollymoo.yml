  Here at Molly Moo Dairy Free Baby Food, we have created a specific range of specialist dairy free mini meals for babies and toddlers. All of our products focus on using the best ingredients possible with no added extras, only an extra special helping of love.

  Each of the products in the Molly Moo range contain ingredients known for their calcium rich qualities because feeding a little one on a dairy free diet is hard enough, without worrying whether they’re getting enough calcium too. And that’s why we are here to help. Each yummy meal contains calcium rich ingredients to help make up your child’s recommended daily intake when you just don’t have time for cooking.

  I’m just getting started at the moment but do keep checking back for all sorts of goodies; from tasty recipes and simple substitutions for everyday dairy products, to snippets of my life here at Molly Moo HQ and tips for living with intolerances.

  Please pop back again soon and feel free to comment on anything that takes your fancy!
